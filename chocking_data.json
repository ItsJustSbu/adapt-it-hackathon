    "content": "Hit it out. If coughing fails to work, you need to give five sharp back blows.\n\nTo do this, help them to lean forwards, supporting their upper body with one hand.\n\nWith the heel of your other hand give them five sharp back blows between their shoulder blades.\n\nAfter each back blow, check to see if there’s anything in their mouth."

    "content": "Squeeze it out. If back blows fail to clear the obstruction, give five abdominal thrusts.\n\nTo do this, stand behind them and put your arms around their waist.\n\nPlace one hand in a clenched fist between their belly button and the bottom of their chest.\n\nWith your other hand, grasp your fist and pull sharply inwards and upwards up to five times. Check their mouth again, each time."
